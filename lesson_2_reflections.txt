What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

# When you initialize a repository terminal pumps out a message stating that the git repository is empty.  You can then check the status of the repository with the command git status.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

# The staging area allows the user to confirm if the commit should be made.  Similar to a confirm before pay page from an online ordering site.
